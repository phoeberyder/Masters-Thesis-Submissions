This is a University of Manchester template for a PhD thesis created by Laura Driessen (www.AstroLaura.com)

By using this template you are agreeing to check *yourself* whether it meets the requirements of the University of Manchester for PhD thesis submission. The guidelines for PhD thesis presentation can be found here: https://www.bmh.manchester.ac.uk/doctoral-academy/your-phd/thesis-submission/presentation-regulations/
I take no responsibility for the suitability of your thesis for submission.

Make sure you change everything that needs changing, like your name (must include the initial of your middle name), your supervisor's name, the colour scheme, the Declaration of Authorship, thesis title etc.

The UoM guidelines require that any blank page has the words ``Blank page'' on it, so I made a command for that. If you'd like to insert a blank page that has ``Blank page'' smack bang in the middle, just use \UoMBlankPage

The guidelines are also a bit weird about numbering, and font is important.

YOU WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE DECLARATION OF AUTHORSHIP PAGE! This is because the declarations depends on whether (and which) bits are published etc, so will vary thesis by thesis.

Not all of the preamble pages are required. You don't have to have lists of symbols, physical constants, abbreviations, popular abstract, preface etc. Read the guidelines to check which ones can be removed and what order they have to be in.

You can use fontspec to set up all the fonts, eg:
>>> \usepackage{fontspec}
>>> \setmainfont{Bitstream Vera Sans}
before \begin{document}, but then you need to go into your overleaf settings and change the LaTeX engine to XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX. I have these lines commented out currently, and instead I'm using \usepackage{mathpazo} which is Palatino font.
You can find a list of the fonts available in overleaf (when using fontspec) here: https://www.overleaf.com/articles/fontspec-all-the-fonts/hjrpnxhrrtxc

And no, those are not the colours I used for my thesis template. I made them particularly garish so that you would choose your own colours (and there's no requirement for your thesis colours to be ugly or black and white, I checked! Colours are good!)! There are some great colour picking tools online, seriously good:

https://coolors.co/
https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-chart/
and if you need to ever convert from RGB to HEX (or vice versa):
https://www.webfx.com/web-design/hex-to-rgb/

You can make the width of the captions different by changing this line in the class file:
\captionsetup{justification=centerlast,font=small,labelfont=sc,margin=10pt}
For example, I changed mine to:
\captionsetup{justification=centerlast,font=small,labelfont={sc,bf, color=boldcolor},margin=1pt}
so that the label is bold and a colour.

Hopefully you've read all of this and checked all of the preamble for yourself to make sure it agrees with university regulations. If you haven't read all this, you might end up surprised with what your dedication says.

Good luck!  Please let me know if you come across any issues and I'll update my master template :D
